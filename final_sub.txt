run these commands:

make clean # careful this will run 'rm -rf *.h.gch Parser/*.out Lexer/lex.yy.c Parser/parser.tab.* Lexer/*.out SymbolTable/*.out ./Quads/*.out'
make # compile the compiler
./Parser/parser.out sample.c 

# run on sample code 
# it will print out the AST tree and the quads. 
# The symbol table printing was turned off 
# but can be re-enabled with the macros in SymbolTable/sym_tab.h
# and also make sure to uncomment these near line 800 of parser.y:
# external-declaration:
#     declaration {
#         // print_symbol_table(CURRENT_SCOPE, 0); // <---- uncomment
#         $$ = NULL;
#     }
#     | function-definition {
#         // print_symbol_table(CURRENT_SCOPE, 0); // <---- uncomment
#         $$ = $1;
#     }

# there are definitely still some bugs but it is a significant portion of the quads working so I hope you enjoy...
